  abstract = {We develop and implement a formalism which enables calculating the analytical gradients of particle-hole random-phase approximation (RPA) ground-state energy with respect to the atomic positions within the atomic orbital basis set framework. Our approach is based on a localized resolution of identity (LRI) approximation for evaluating the two-electron Coulomb integrals and their derivatives, and the density functional perturbation theory for computing the first-order derivatives of the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals and orbital energies. Our implementation allows one to relax molecular structures at the RPA level using both Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). Benchmark calculations against previous implementations show that our approach delivers adequate numerical precision, highlighting the usefulness of LRI in the context of RPA gradient evaluations. A careful assessment of the quality of RPA geometries for small molecules reveals that post-KS RPA systematically overestimates the bond lengths. We furthermore optimized the geometries of the four low-lying water hexamers-cage, prism, cyclic, and book isomers, and determined the energy hierarchy of these four isomers using RPA. The obtained RPA energy ordering is in good agreement with that yielded by the coupled cluster method with single, double and perturbative triple excitations, despite that the dissociation energies themselves are appreciably underestimated. The underestimation of the dissociation energies by RPA is well corrected by the renormalized single excitation correction.},

              the many-electron Schr$\ddot\{\text\{o\}\}$dinger equation. In this work we propose
              a single-layer fully connected neural network adapted from RBM and apply it to
              study ab initio quantum chemistry problems. Our contribution is two-fold: 1)
              our neural network only uses real numbers to represent the real electronic wave
              function, while we obtain comparable precision to RBM for various prototypical
              molecules; 2) we show that the knowledge of the Hartree-Fock reference state
              can be used to systematically accelerate the convergence of the variational
              Monte Carlo algorithm as well as to increase the precision of the final energy.},

  abstract = {Quantum computational chemistry (QCC) is the use of quantum computers to solve problems in computational quantum chemistry. We develop a high performance variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator for simulating quantum computational chemistry problems on a new Sunway supercomputer. The major innovations include: (1) a Matrix Product State (MPS) based VQE simulator to reduce the amount of memory needed and increase the simulation efficiency; (2) a combination of the Density Matrix Embedding Theory with the MPS-based VQE simulator to further extend the simulation range; (3) A three-level parallelization scheme to scale up to 20 million cores; (4) Usage of the Julia script language as the main programming language, which both makes the programming easier and enables cutting edge performance as native C or Fortran; (5) Study of real chemistry systems based on the VQE simulator, achieving nearly linearly strong and weak scaling. Our simulation demonstrates the power of VQE for large quantum chemistry systems, thus paves the way for large-scale VQE experiments on near-term quantum computers.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy provides chemical and compositional information that can serve as a structural fingerprint for various materials. Therefore, simulations of Raman spectra, including both quantum perturbation analyses and ground-state calculations, are of significant interest. However, highly accurate full quantum mechanical (QM) simulations of Raman spectra have previously been confined to small systems. For large systems such as biological materials, full QM simulations have an extremely high computational cost and remain challenging. In this work, robust new algorithms and advanced implementations on many-core architectures are employed to enable fast, accurate, and massively parallel full ab initio simulations of the Raman spectra of realistic biological systems containing up to 3006 atoms, with excellent strong and weak scaling. Up to a performance of 468.5 PFLOP/s in double-precision and 813.7 PLOPS/s in mixed-half precision is achieved on the new-generation Sunway high-performance computing system, suggesting the potential for new applications of the QM approach to biological systems.},

  abstract = {Vacancy and its clusters are among the most important defects induced by self-irradiation in plutonium-gallium (Pu-Ga) alloys. For decades-long stockpiles, the generation and evolution of vacancy defects could cause void swelling and helium bubble formation, resulting in the ageing of the Pu-Ga alloys. Therefore, to shed light on the ageing mechanisms caused by vacancies in Pu-Ga alloys, the long-term behaviour of vacancy defects in Pu-Ga alloys is simulated employing an AKMC model parameterized by molecular statics calculations. By tracking the number of vacancy defects, the size distribution of vacancy clusters, and the largest vacancy clusters over time, we found that temperature and Ga concentration significantly influence the evolution of vacancy defects in Pu-Ga alloys. Temperature changes could affect the clustering behaviour of mono vacancies, and critical temperatures initializing the nucleation of vacancy clusters are observed. On the other hand, adding Ga contents in Pu-Ga alloys could increase the migration energy of and attractive interaction among vacancies, leading to increased vacancy cluster numbers at high temperatures.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) non-van der Waals magnetic materials have attracted considerable attention due to their high-temperature ferromagnetism, active surface/interface properties originating from dangling bonds, and good stability under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis and systematic Raman investigation of ultrathin non-van der Waals antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-MnSe single crystals. Square and triangular nanosheets with different growth orientations can be achieved by introducing different precursors via the atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method. The temperature-dependent resonant enhancement in the Raman intensity of two peaks at 233.8 cm-1 and 459.9 cm-1 gives obvious evidence that the antiferromagnetic spin-ordering is below TN ‚àº 160 K. Besides, a new peak located at 254.2 cm-1, gradually appearing as the temperature decreased from 180 K to 100 K, may also be a signature of phase transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic. The phonon dispersion spectra of $\alpha$-MnSe simulated by density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) match well with the observed Raman signals. Moreover, a fabricated $\alpha$-MnSe phototransistor exhibits p-type conducting behavior and high photodetection performance. We believe that these findings will be beneficial for the applications of 2D $\alpha$-MnSe in magnetic and semiconducting fields.},

  abstract = {Since the interaction between electrons and atomic nuclei can affect the electronic structure, in recent years, first-principles-based electron-phonon renormalization methods have been applied in the condensed matter physics community to account for the influence of the electron-phonon coupling in solid systems. However, little is yet known about the behavior and trends of the electron-phonon renormalization in the molecules. In this work, the method for the electron-phonon renormalization in molecules has been derived, using which, we exhaustively investigate the zero-point renormalization in 32 molecules with three different density functions. We find that the renormalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap due to electron-vibration coupling does not relate to the atomic masses but quite relates to the electronic structure properties of the molecules.},

  abstract = {Electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction plays an important role in addressing the renormalization of the electronic structure properties. Even at 0 K, such e-ph renormalization still exists because of the zero-point motion of the nuclei, which is known as zero-point renormalization (ZPR). Cardona and Thewalt have found that, for monoatomic materials, the ZPR should be proportional to the inverse square root of the atomic mass. In order to thoughtfully examine the mass factor with the accurate all-electron first-principles approach, we calculate the ZPR of the electronic structure for 82 octet binary materials in both the zincblende and the rocksalt structures. We found that only considering the mass factor is not enough for the ZPR, especially for the investigated polar materials. Besides the mass factor, the lattice geometry, the electronic band structure properties, and the long-range polar corrections are also need to be considered.},

  abstract = {Hybrid density-functional calculation is one of the most commonly adopted electronic structure theories in computational chemistry and materials science because of its balance between accuracy and computational cost. Recently, we have developed a novel scheme called NAO2GTO to achieve linear scaling (Order-N) calculations for hybrid density-functionals. In our scheme, the most time-consuming step is the calculation of the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) part, so creating an even distribution of these ERIs in parallel implementation is an issue of particular importance. Here, we present two static scalable distributed algorithms for the ERIs computation. Firstly, the ERIs are distributed over ERIs shell pairs. Secondly, the ERIs are distributed over ERIs shell quartets. In both algorithms, the calculation of ERIs is independent of each other, so the communication time is minimized. We show our speedup results to demonstrate the performance of these static parallel distributed algorithms in the Hefei Order-N packages for ab initio simulations.},

  abstract = {Within density-functional theory, perturbation theory (PT) is the state-of-the-art formalism for assessing the response to homogeneous electric fields and the associated material properties, e.g., polarizabilities, dielectric constants, and Raman intensities. Here, we derive a real-space formulation of PT and present an implementation within the all-electron, numeric atom-centered orbitals electronic structure code FHI-aims that allows for massively parallel calculations. As demonstrated by extensive validation, we achieve a rapid computation of accurate response properties of molecules and solids. As an application showcase, we present harmonic and anharmonic Raman spectra, the latter obtained by combining hundreds of thousands of PT calculations with ab initio molecular dynamics. By using the PBE exchange-correlation functional with many-body van der Waals corrections, we obtain spectra in good agreement with experiment especially with respect to lineshapes for the isolated paracetamol molecule and two polymorphs of the paracetamol crystal.},

  abstract = {Abstract The role of Li in Li/MgO as a catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is to promote MgO surface morphology change rather than serve as a constituent of catalytically active sites. While Li/MgO is unstable at realistic conditions with respect to loss of Li, the resulting samples show enhanced selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons versus CO2, although activity is low and close to pristine MgO. The way (co-)doping with alio-valent metal ions affects the catalytic performance of Li/MgO has now been explored. To analyze the structure and the stability of the samples, catalysts with well-defined stoichiometry were prepared using a co-precipitation method with freeze-drying and subsequent annealing. Gd and Fe were used as dopants. Apart from their potential direct role in catalysis, these dopants are anticipated to stabilize Li in the catalyst under the reaction conditions, allowing further clarification of the role of Li. In the case of Gd/Li co-doping, changes observed in EPR and 7Li-NMR spectra indicate the formation of correlated, next-neighbor Li?Mg???Gd+Mg pairs co-existing with ÔøΩÔøΩisolatedÔøΩÔøΩ Gd3+ ions at octahedral Mg lattice sites. For Li/Fe co-doping, no significant change in the EPR pattern is observed in the presence of Li+ ions, indicating a larger distance between the Li+ and Fe3+ cations in the MgO lattice. Hybrid DFT calculations explain the difference between Fe and Gd co-doping by a less efficient screening of the Coulomb repulsion between Gd3+ and neighboring cations in Gd doped samples, leading to the stabilization of LiMg near GdMg.},

Polarons represent a crucial intermediate step populated immediately after dissociation of the excitons formed in the primary photoabsorption process. Here we present a novel approach to studying photoexcited polarons in an important photoactive oxide, ZnO, using infrared (IR) reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) with a time resolution of 100 ms. For well-defined (10-10) oriented ZnO single-crystal substrates, we observe intense IR absorption bands at around 200 meV exhibiting a pronounced temperature dependence. On the basis of first-principles-based electronic structure calculations, we assign these features to hole polarons of intermediate coupling strength.},
