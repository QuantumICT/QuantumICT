abstract = {Quantum Computing is believed to be the ultimate solution for quantum chemistry problems. Before the advent of large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising heuristic quantum algorithm to solve real world quantum chemistry problems on near-term noisy quantum computers. Here we propose a highly parallelizable classical simulator for VQE based on the matrix product state representation of quantum state, which significantly extend the simulation range of the existing simulators. Our simulator seamlessly integrates the quantum circuit evolution into the classical auto-differentiation framework, thus the gradients could be computed efficiently similar to the classical deep neural network, with a scaling that is independent of the number of variational parameters. As applications, we use our simulator to study commonly used small molecules such as HF, HCl, LiH and H 2 O, as well as larger molecules CO 2 , BeH 2 and H 4 with up to 40 qubits. The favorable scaling of our simulator against the number of qubits and the number of parameters could make it an ideal testing ground for near-term quantum algorithms and a perfect benchmarking baseline for oncoming large scale VQE experiments on noisy quantum computers.},

abstract = {Quantum computing is attracting more and more attention in material and biological science. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is expected as an effective method to solve quantum chemistry problems which has potential quantum advantage. Classically simulating quantum algorithms plays a critical role in algorithmic development and the validation of noisy quantum devices before large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are developed. However, most existing simulators are based on the state vector or density matrix representation of the quantum state which is faced with the memory bottleneck due to the exponential growth of memory requirement as the number of qubits increases. In this work, we present a VQE simulator based on the matrix product states (MPS) method from quantum many-body physics, and a detailed study of our MPS-VQE simulator in quantum chemistry applications. The memory requirement of MPS-VQE grows only polynomially and we demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained despite the truncation of the smallest singular values during the algorithm. A distributed parallelization scheme is also presented for massively parallel computer systems, and different implementations of the parallelization scheme based on the Julia language are benchmarked which demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our method. Our method could open a new avenue towards large-scale classical simulation of quantum computational chemistry.}

@article{Qin2023,
abstract = {The NAO2GTO scheme provides an efficient way to evaluate the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) over numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) with auxiliary Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs). However, the NAO2GTO fitting will significantly impact the accuracy and convergence of hybrid functional calculations. To address this issue, here we propose to use the fitted orbitals as a new numerical basis to properly handle the mismatch between NAOs and fitted GTOs. We present an efficient and linear-scaling implementation of analytical gradients of Hartree-Fock exchange (HFX) energy for periodic HSE06 calculations with fitted NAOs in the HONPAS package. In our implementation, the ERIs and their derivatives for HFX matrix and forces are evaluated analytically with the auxiliary GTOs, while other terms are calculated using numerically discretized GTOs. Several integral screening techniques are employed to reduce the number of required ERI derivatives. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency of our implementation and demonstrate that our results of lattice constants, bulk moduli, and band gaps of several typical semiconductors are in good agreement with the experimental values. We also show that the calculation of HFX forces based on a master-worker dynamic parallel scheme has a very high efficiency and scales linearly with respect to system size. Finally, we study the geometry optimization and polaron formation due to an excess electron in rutile TiO 2 by means of HSE06 calculations to further validate the applicability of our implementation.},

abstract = {Exploring the potential applications of quantum computers in material design and drug discovery is attracting more and more attention after quantum advantage has been demonstrated using Gaussian boson sampling. However, quantum resource requirements in material and (bio)molecular simulations are far beyond the capacity of near-term quantum devices. In this work, multiscale quantum computing is proposed for quantum simulations of complex systems by integrating multiple computational methods at different scales of resolution. In this framework, most computational methods can be implemented in an efficient way on classical computers, leaving the critical portion of the computation to quantum computers. The simulation scale of quantum computing strongly depends on available quantum resources. As a near-term scheme, we integrate adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithms, second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory and Hartree-Fock theory within the framework of the many-body expansion fragmentation approach. This new algorithm is applied to model systems consisting of hundreds of orbitals with decent accuracy on the classical simulator. This work should encourage further studies on quantum computing for solving practical material and biochemistry problems.},

abstract = {Quantum computing is moving beyond its early stage and seeking for commercial applications in chemical and biomedical sciences. In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era, the quantum resource is too scarce to support these explorations. Therefore, it is valuable to emulate quantum computing on classical computers for developing quantum algorithms and validating quantum hardware. However, existing simulators mostly suffer from the memory bottleneck so developing the approaches for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a high-performance and massively parallel variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator based on matrix product states, combined with embedding theory for solving large-scale quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry on HPC platforms. We apply this method to study the torsional barrier of ethane and the quantification of the protein–ligand interactions. Our largest simulation reaches 1000 qubits, and a performance of 216.9 PFLOP/s is achieved on a new Sunway supercomputer, which sets the state-of-the-art for quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry.},
